# R for Data Science Laboratory (RDS-LAB)

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of lab activities, assignments, and code examples from my R for Data Science course. The codebase demonstrates various R programming concepts, data manipulation techniques, statistical analysis, and visualisation methods learned throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

### Units
The repository is organized into four main units, each focusing on different aspects of R programming:

- **Unit 1**: Basic R programming concepts
  - Mathematical computations (square, square root, exponential operations)
  - Variable assignment and basic operations
  - Simple data structures

- **Unit 2**: Data structures and array manipulation
  - Multi-dimensional arrays
  - Matrices and vectors
  - Data sequence generation

- **Unit 3**: Matrix operations and logical indexing
  - Identity matrices
  - Element location and indexing
  - Advanced matrix operations

- **Unit 4**: Advanced R programming concepts
  - Complex data analysis
  - Statistical operations

### Assignments
The repository includes five assignment sets completed as part of the course curriculum:

- **1st Assignment**: Introductory R programming tasks
- **2nd Assignment**: Data structure manipulation
- **3rd Assignment**: Statistical analysis
- **4th Assignment**: Comprehensive data analysis
- **5th Assignment**: Advanced R programming concepts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
